# MagicMirror
Networks Final Project
Group Members - Aaron Weinberg, Kevin Hewitt, Andrew Krager

Instructions for installing the program - As it stands you just run each of the API calls separately, when they are built into the raspberry pi at the end of the project, it will require no setup other than entering your credentials for Facebook, twitter, and your location, just to use the mirror as you would.

Instructions for compiling and running - Just run each API call program separately at the moment, they are all in java at the moment, although this may be changed to python on the raspberry pi, but just the basic javac command should compile then java to run.

Instructions for using the software - Running each of the API will do only one specific thing at the moment, but the final project will be able to more than just these test functions
